      For desserts, our site is an advanced recipe site.
There are many recipe apps and websites on the market today, including
of famous chefs
We came up with a brilliant solution that will give users a different level of experience
the site.
When people enter the kitchen to prepare something, they often encounter
In a frustrating situation of 'whoops, I don't have all the materials'
Then either the grocery store is far away or it's late and here's a username
The site abandons the recipe with a bitter taste in its mouth
And a mother of an allergic child who builds on some irritating recipe and in the end finds out that it is
Contains a component that is dangerous for the girl
Our site enters exactly this niche and offers a solution:
First of all let us know what your available supplies are/are not
are relevant - and according to this we will give you the recipes that suit you.
No more surfing and flipping through dozens of irrelevant recipes and feeling hungry
pinching From today you receive only relevant and practical recipes!
In addition, we offer the user to receive an indication of the rating of the recipe,
When a user sees a high rating it gives him confidence and certainty about
Choosing the recipe
There will be additional filter options in order to make the adjustment of the recipe more accurate
to the seeker
And of course a personal area that will be the cache of all the recipes you liked
We set a goal before our eyes to give our user an efficient browsing experience
Effective and of course tasty
